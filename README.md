## Network Utilities in Google App Script

This is a series of quick and dirty network utilities that allow you to get additiional information
about an IP address from a Google Spreadsheet.

Each utility is in its own directory and has two components:

* a function in Google App Script
* a PHP script

For convenience, an "everything" directory that contains all of the utilities and corresponding scripts is provided.
